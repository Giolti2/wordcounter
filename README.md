# wordcounter

Small program to read results downloaded from the SimpleScraper extension as a .csv file and write the number of each word's occurrences in an excel file.
The file will be generated in a new folder next to the input file.

In order to run the program, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [XlsxWriter package](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/getting_started.html).

TODO: make the list ordered, as of now the list is unordered but can be ordered manually in Excel.
